        <h3>The creations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The charcoal feels smooth as you drag across the paper
            </li>
            <li>
                The paper is course and grips the charcoal well as you go
            </li>
            <li>
                The mess can spread easily however leaving your hands black
            </li>
            <li>
                The final piece however can have amazing detail to them with work and shades

        <h3>How to start</h3>
        Charcoal is a very obvious start.
        <ul>
            <li>
                There are different shades of charcoal
            </li>
            <li>Different shapes to use charcoal in</li>
            <li>Even different colors of charcoal such as white</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class="directionImage" src="./images/charcoal-stick.jpg" alt="sticks">
        <div class="direction">
            <h3>Choose wisely</h3>
            There are softer and harder sticks to be used, the softer sticks leave nice lines but dont last very long while the harder ones can be stubborn to leave marks at first.
        </div>

        <img class="directionImage" src="./images/charcoal.webp" alt="different materials">
        <div class="direction">
            <h3>Different materials</h3>
            <p>
                Sticks arent the only things used for drawing. As stated before
                the softer sticks go on easy and are used up quickly while the sticks are needed for harsher lines due to having to press harder.
                pencils are very useful for more precise strokes and can be a very good middle ground between the two sticks.
                Finally crushed charcoal can be rubbed on or used with a paint brush to get lighter tones and details.

            <h3>Paper</h3>
            <p>
                The paper you choose will help with the creation.
                go within your own budged but if you can grab the more
                expensive type of paper it will hold the charcoal better and give a better picture after.

            <h3>Final results</h3>
            <p>
                Through time, practice, and patients you can create an image of whatever you want to imagine.
                This one is one of my previews works that I really enjoyed making, even a mix and mash of different images such as this can create something fun. </p>            </p>
