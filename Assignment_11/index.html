        <p><b>The Cowplant</b> is a plant within the sims universe. A very strange plant that is found only a few ways, such as foraging for it after a certain skill level or through space travel when getting that job level.
        The cow plant grows from a seed that grows into a tiny plant with horns (see right), Personally I find the plant cute in all stages. 
        </p>
        <p>To get the <i>Sim</i> to be able to get the ability to ge the plant is through work progress as an <span id="confusion">astronaut or as a gardener.</span>
        Their work in either one will result in the possibilty of getting the plant seed, along with other things that can help your sim or simple collectables.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="transform">The fully grown cowplant as seen on the left is a huge plant with a cake as a tongue. They can be played with, fed, or ignored if so choosen to. However with being ignored they will use that tongue as <b>bait</b>.
            They will lure sims in with the cake and can eat sims if they are willing to try grabbing it without intervention.</span>
